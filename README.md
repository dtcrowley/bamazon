Bamazon is a real-time database using MySQL, Node.js and JavaScript to keep a detailed inventory and account record for hypothetical retail giant, Bamazon.

The Bamazon database will display product names, their departments, price and the current quantity for easy inventoy analysis and basic bookkeeping. 

Driven by JavaScript, channeled by Node and stored by MySQL, Bamazon is a very useful and convenient tool for this ever so creatively named, fake, totally-not-a-rip-off-of-any-other-major-corporation, company.
